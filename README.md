# dicewars #

DiceWars is a (quite addictive) quick game, inspired by the
[Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) board game.
It mixes strategy and luck, the objective is to conquer all areas on a
map by dice rolls.

**dicewars** implements the logic (the backend) that is required to create
playable game GUIs (the frontends) and (multi player) game servers in Python.
