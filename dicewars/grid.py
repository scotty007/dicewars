Generate random hexagonal cell grids.

:class:`Grid`\s are composed of hexagonal :class:`Cell`\s.
Groups of adjacent :class:`Cell`\s are assigned to adjacent
:class:`Area`\s of random size and shape.

All :class:`Cell` and :class:`Area` references are indices into the
:attr:`Grid.cells` and :attr:`Grid.areas` tuples, respectively.

:class:`Grid` instances are immutable and intended for
:class:`~dicewars.game.Game` generation, but may be useful for other
hex-map based games as well. They provide coordinates for convenient
frontend map rendering.

.. attribute:: grid_x
   :type: int

   The cell's grid column.

.. attribute:: grid_y
   :type: int

   The cell's grid row.

.. attribute:: area
   :type: int

   The index of the :class:`Area` the cell is assigned to, `-1` if not assigned.

.. attribute:: border
   :type: tuple(tuple(int, int))

   of the hexagonal cell polygon on the map (in counter-clockwise order,
